\title{============================================================EEG Re-referencing Utilities

This module provides functions to re-reference EEG recordings to
different reference schemes (e.g., common average or selected channels)
within the eeganalysis framework for downstream preprocessing and analysis.Author: Christos DalamarinisDate: 2026

Re-reference EEG data}
\usage{
eeg_rereference(eeg, ref = "average", exclude = NULL, copy = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{eeg}{An EEG object as used in this package.}

\item{ref}{Character or integer vector specifying the new reference
channel(s). Use \code{"average"} to apply a common average reference.}

\item{exclude}{Optional character or integer vector of channels to
exclude from computing the reference (e.g., EOG, EMG).}

\item{copy}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, return a new EEG object and leave
\code{eeg} unchanged. If \code{FALSE}, re-reference \code{eeg} in place
(if your class supports this).}
}
\value{
An EEG object with updated reference.
}
\description{
Change the reference of EEG signals to a new set of reference channels
or to the common average across channels.
}
\details{
EEG data are measured as voltage differences between each electrode
and a reference electrode. Re-referencing applies a linear transformation
so that all channels are expressed relative to the new reference defined
by \code{ref}.\link{web:6}

If \code{ref = "average"}, the reference signal is computed as the mean
across all non-excluded EEG channels at each time point (common average
reference).\link[=web:25]{web:6}
When one or several channels are specified in \code{ref}, the reference
signal is the mean of those channels at each time point.\link{web:20}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Common average reference
eeg_avg <- eeg_rereference(eeg, ref = "average")

# Re-reference to linked mastoids M1/M2
eeg_mastoids <- eeg_rereference(eeg, ref = c("M1", "M2"))
}
